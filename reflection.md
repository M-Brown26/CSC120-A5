- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

When it comes to association, I understand the concept, but it's way harder while coding. It was confusing to figure out how to connect everything. However, it really helped when I drew out a diagram of what information was going where (aka what each class took from another). My advice for someone would be to try and use visuals, to make everything seem less hectic.
